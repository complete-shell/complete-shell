# This is the search index for complete-shell. It is used by the complete-shell
# 'search' and 'install' commands. You can add to this list by submitting a
# pull request for your additions.
#
# Each entry must contain a 'name' field as its first line. Other lines may
# follow with extra fields, if needed: The valid fields are as follows:
#
#   'name' - The name of the entry which is usually the name of the command for
#   which completion is being provided.
#
#   'desc' - The description of the entry/command.
#
#   'tags' - A space separated list of tags (words) for the entry. The tag can
#   be used to install many compdefs at once. Like this:
#
#       complete-shell install @some-tag
#
#   'from' - The location where source code for the completion lives. This is
#   usually a GitHub repository URL, but could be other things. The default
#   value is based off of the name field:
#
#       https://github.com/complete-shell/complete-<name>
#
#   'type' - Specifies the type of the 'from' field. Currently the default (and
#   only valid value) is 'git'.
#
#   'branch' - If 'from' is a Git repository, this is the branch where the
#   compdef code lives. The default is 'master'.
#
#   'path' - Since compdefs may be a part of another project, they may live in
#   a subdirectory. This is the relative path of where the compdef code lives.
#   The default is '.'.
#
#   'cmds' - This is a space separated list of commands that this compdef
#   should be applied to. The default is the value of 'name', but sometimes a
#   command may go by different names, or 2 similar commands might use the same
#   compdef.
